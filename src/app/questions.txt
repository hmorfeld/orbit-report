Questions: 
Local host not working
"app-orbit-list" not a known element; how do I verify that it is part of the module?
Can't bind to 'satellites' since it isn't a known property of 'app-orbit-list'. ^ same as above.
Not really understanding how to use shouldShowWaring  to add the warning CSS class to the <td> containing the satellite's type
An argument for "name" was not provided in new satellite? But it was? 
Getting this when I go git push
    error: update_ref failed for ref 'refs/remotes/origin/master': cannot lock ref 'refs/remotes/origin/master':
